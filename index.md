## Getting Started
To get started with YTSync, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Henrykanjo/ytsync/releases). Look for the file you need to download and execute.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.
- A Plex media server set up and running.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install YTSync:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Henrykanjo/ytsync.git
   cd ytsync
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ytsync .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name ytsync -v /path/to/config:/config ytsync
   ```

Replace `/path/to/config` with the path where you want to store the configuration files.

## Configuration
YTSync requires a configuration file to run. Create a `config.yml` file in the config directory with the following structure:

```yaml
youtube:
  channels:
    - channel_id_1
    - channel_id_2
  playlists:
    - playlist_id_1
    - playlist_id_2

plex:
  host: "http://localhost:32400"
  token: "your_plex_token"
```

### YouTube Configuration
- **channels**: List the YouTube channel IDs you want to sync.
- **playlists**: List the YouTube playlist IDs you want to sync.

### Plex Configuration
- **host**: The URL of your Plex server.
- **token**: Your Plex token for authentication.

## Usage
To start the synchronization process, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it ytsync python main.py
```

This command will initiate the syncing of your specified YouTube channels and playlists to your Plex server.

### Scheduling Syncs
You can set up a cron job to run the sync command at regular intervals. For example, to run the sync every hour, add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 * * * * docker exec -it ytsync python main.py
```

## Advanced Features
YTSync offers several advanced features to enhance your media management:

### Intelligent Filtering
You can filter downloads based on various criteria, such as:
- Video duration
- Upload date
- Keywords in the title or description

Add filters to your `config.yml` under the YouTube section:

```yaml
filters:
  duration: "short"  # options: short, medium, long
  keywords:
    - "tutorial"
    - "review"
```

### Error Handling
YTSync includes built-in error handling to manage download failures. If a video fails to download, it will log the error and continue with the next video.

### Logging
You can enable logging in your configuration file to track the syncing process:

```yaml
logging:
  level: "info"  # options: debug, info, warning, error
```

Logs will be stored in the specified config directory.
